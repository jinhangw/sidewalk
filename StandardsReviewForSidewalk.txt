Main accessibility issues:
Street-level accessibility: routes, sidewalk maintenance, ramp at crossing, bus stop, etc.
Building accessibility: entrance, restrooms, elevator, etc.
Barriers: steps, high curbs, deep gutters, steep gradients, etc.
Surface: cobbled surfaces, gravel, grass, etc.
Parking lot.
Others’ work:
AXSmap: a crowdsourcing app collecting accessibility information. (too little coverage to be helpful at this point)
Yelp: people comment on yelp.com about the accessibility of any places of interest.
Tohme: Detecting Curb Ramps in Google Street View Using Crowdsourcing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning 
What we could try:
1. Pothole detection with gyro and accelerometer on concrete broken pavement

2. Traffic signs for pedestrians

3. Image inventory for sidewalks as a guide for trip planning. 
4. Retroreflectivity of pedestrian crossing (zebra crossing)
5. Accessible Transportation: we detect bus stops and assess the accessibility around.

####Roughness:

1.20 in/ft
0.60 in/ft for longer surfaces

Based on the combination of RMS data and subjective feedback from wheelchair users, we are proposing a roughness index threshold of 1.20 in/ft for any short distance segments (less than 10 ft). For longer surfaces (greater than 100ft), a roughness index of 0.60 in/ft should be adopted.
To calculate roughness, a profile of the surface with a resolution of 1 mm should be used.
The profile should be filtered with a “wheelpath” algorithm with a 2.5 in diameter wheel.

BY WHEELCHAIRS USERS: FINAL REPORT

Another study result (from University of Pittsburgh):
The roughness index can be correlated to wheelchair user comfort based on research by the University of Pittsburgh. This research found that a surface with more than 1.28 in./ft of vertical variation is not good (painful) for wheelchair users with 0.9in./ft is an average acceptable condition.

####Changes in Level:

0.25 inch
0.5 inch with bevel

ADA Standards 303 Changes in Level
 303.2 Vertical.  Changes in level of ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high maximum shall be permitted to be vertical.
 303.3 Beveled.  Changes in level between ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high minimum and ½ inch (13 mm) high maximum shall be beveled with a slope not steeper than 1:2.
 303.4 Ramps.  Changes in level greater than ½ inch (13 mm) high shall be ramped, and shall comply with 405 or 406
 Running slope: 1:20
 Cross-slope: 1:50
 
####Surface Roughness: Surfaces should be stable, firm & slip resistant

Hardened materials such as concrete, asphalt, tile, and wood are sufficiently firm and stable for accessibility.
Most loose materials, including gravel will not meet these requirements unless properly treated to provide sufficient surface integrity and resilience.  Binders, consolidants, compaction, and grid forms may enable some of these materials to perform satisfactorily but require repeated maintenance.
Cobblestones and other rough surfaces make wheelchair travel difficult and uncomfortable. 

####Opening: Openings in ground and floor surfaces, such as grates, are limited in width to prevent passage of a ½” diameter sphere.  Wheelchair casters can get wedged into wider openings.

####Clearances:

The minimum 36” continuous clear width of accessible routes can reduce to 32” at points, such as doorways, for a maximum distance of 24”. Greater clearance is required for 180 degree turns around narrow obstructions and for wheelchair turning space.
Additional clearance is required at 180 degree turns around an element that is less than 48” wide. The clear width must be at least 48” at the turn and 42” minimum approaching the turn (unless the clear width at the turn is 60” minimum).
Passing space is required every 200 feet and must be provided as a 60” by 60” minimum space or as T-shaped space where each stem is at least 48” long.

####Medians and Islands:

According to ADAAG, a raised island or median should be level with the street or have curb ramps at all sides and a level area 1.220 m (48 in) long in all directions. If a cut-through design is used, it should be at least 0.915 m (36 in) wide.

####Pedestrian-Actuated traffic control:

ADAAG Section 4.10.3 states that elevator buttons should be located no higher than 1.065 m (42 in) (ADAAG, U.S. Access Board,1991). buttons should be raised above or flush with their housings and be at least 50 mm (2 in) in the smallest dimension (U.S. Access Board, 1994b).
